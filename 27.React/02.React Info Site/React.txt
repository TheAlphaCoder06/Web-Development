//Challenge

/*
    Starting from scratch, build and render the HTML for our section project. Check the Foofle slide for what you're trying to build.
    We'll be adding styling ro ir later.
    Hints:
    * The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can access it by using 'src="./react-logo.png" in your image element
    * You can also set the 'width' attribute of the image element just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px.


import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <h1 className='heading'>Fun Facts about React</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
          <li>Was originally created by Jordan Walke</li>
          <li>It is declarative</li>
          <li>It is composable</li>
          <li>Is maintained by facebook</li>
        </ul>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

The component name should be capitalized, it should not be camel case

React components are functions which return React elements. It can be used over and over again.

Put styles.css inside src folder
